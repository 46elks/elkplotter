Do you have a AxiDraw_ pen plotter and want it to plot an image generated by AI
from a prompt you send via SMS? Then this project is for you!

This project will:

1. Receive a prompt via SMS with 46elks_, e.g. "a moose riding a snowboard"
2. Generate an image with `DALL·E`_
3. Vectorize the image with vpype_ and vpype-vectrace_
4. Send the image to a connected AxiDraw plotter and begin plotting

You will need:

* A computer with a connected AxiDraw_ pen plotter
* A 46elks_ account with an SMS-enabled phone number
* An OpenAI_ account
* An internet facing server that can receive the SMS messages from 46elks.

The project is divided into a server and potentially multiple clients. The
server receives SMS messages, generates and vectorizes the image and sends it
to the plotter over a websocket. Clients connect to the server via websocket
and receives images to plot.

See ``server/README.rst`` and ``client/README.rst`` for more information about
how to use the project.
